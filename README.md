# MastersScholarship Unit Tests â€“ TDD Sample

## ðŸ§ª Overview

This project demonstrates **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using the MSTest framework to verify the behavior of the `MastersScholarship` class. The tests focus on GPA-based scholarship assignment, internal state tracking, and object-level encapsulation.

---

## âœ… Key Features Tested

- **GPA-based Scholarship Awards**:
  - GPA â‰¥ 8: High GPA â€“ maximum scholarship
  - GPA â‰¥ 7 and < 8: Medium GPA â€“ partial scholarship
  - GPA < 7: Low GPA â€“ review required

- **Assessment Count Tracking**:
  - A static counter tracks how many students have been assessed
  - A reset method clears the counter

- **Encapsulation Check**:
  - Confirms that scholarship values are specific to each instance
  - Verifies that one objectâ€™s scholarship values do not affect another

---

## ðŸ”¬ Test Coverage

- Scholarship messages are accurate based on GPA tiers
- Assessment counter increments correctly across multiple objects
- `ResetAssessmentCount()` correctly sets count back to zero
- Private-set properties do not carry over between different instances

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All tests use `Assert.IsTrue` or `Assert.AreEqual` to verify correctness
- Tests are named to clearly express intent and expected behavior
- Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate clean unit testing and TDD practices
